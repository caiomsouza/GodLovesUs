# God Loves Us | Building Zion | Kingdom of God

This is a personal repo to help me to remember the love of God for us. 

For God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life.
<b>John 3:16</b>
 
Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt you in due time:
Casting all your care upon him; for he careth for you.
<b>1 Peter 5:6-7</b>
